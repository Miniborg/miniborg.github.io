<p style="font-family:Sans; color:DarkGreen; font-size: 19px;">Website shut down for maintenance. Will probably be open until 4:10 CST. This is NOT the wrong website. You entered https://novasgreat.github.io right? The game website? So please wait for it to go up again. See ya! (NOTE: If the text is green, then the website is updating. NOT in maintenance)</p>
